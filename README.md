## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `bun install` (or `npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn`), you can start a development server:

```bash
bun start

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun start -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
